# Reac2Vac

Reac2vac.online - Your Doctor's Guide to Vaccine Adverse Events
- Applied natural language processing, regular expression, unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques to 450,000 reports from the VAERS database, the US surveillance program tracking relationships (if any) between adverse events (mild-to-severe) and vaccines.
- Analyzed, processed the data using R (dplyr, reshape2) and Python (pandas, scikitlearn).
Created an online web application using Flask / Bootstrap applying HTML / CSS / JSON programming. The web application is running via Amazon Web Services (EBS-optimised EC2 instance).
- The project has been created from scratch to web delivery under 3 weeks.
